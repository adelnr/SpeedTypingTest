# Speed Typing Test

This Python script provides a speed typing test using the curses library. It displays a random line of text and measures your typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

## Requirements

To run this script, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- curses (part of the Python standard library)

## Usage

1. Run the `speed_typing_test.py` script.

2. The program will display a start screen with a welcome message. Press any key to start the test.

3. A random line of text will appear on the screen, and you need to type it as accurately and quickly as possible.

4. Your typing speed will be measured in WPM (words per minute), which updates in real-time as you type.

5. Incorrect characters will be displayed in red, and correct characters will be displayed in green.

6. Once you have completed typing the entire text correctly, a message will appear indicating your completion.

7. Press any key to start the test again.

8. Press the "Esc" key (27) to exit the program.
